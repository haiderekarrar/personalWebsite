    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <h3>The Spinning Donut</h3>
            <h4>Highschool Project (11th grade)</h4>
            <p>
                Founded as a new student and managed virtually. Built a team of four people based on their concentrated interests. Kept the team motivated despite the time-consuming pressures of college applications and academics. Built by reasoning up from First Principles. Initiated my school’s first-ever participation in the National Space Society Space Settlement Contest.

    <h2>Skills</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>C++, HTML, Javascript</li>
        <li>I successfully managed the sale of my parents' home over the phone, overcoming challenges including negotiating with an aggressive tenant (who had “trashed” the house and initially refused to leave), and handling a faulty furnace in a below-freezing winter. Basic renovations were done at less than one-tenth of estimated cost. Overall, saved hundreds of thousands of dollars.</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
        <li>English and Urdu are my native languages. I can also semi-fluently speak Hindi and am able to understand Punjabi.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Hobbies</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>I enjoy reading and weightlifting. I went on a two-month-long bulk each in 2022 and 2023, and was able to gain an almost unrealistic 62 pounds of muscle (from 129 to 191 pounds).</li>
        <li>Fun fact about me: during my teenage years, I dedicated myself to becoming a professional mixed marital artist.</li>
    </ul>

    <br /><br />
